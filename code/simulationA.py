# Simulation A
#
# Settings:
# --------
# All taps = 5
# Hour = 12
# No PVs

# Outputs:
# -------
# ../results/SimulationA.pdf
# Voltage magnitudes plot. 

# Requirements:
# -------------
# 1. Make sure the simulation can be run from code folder:
#
#    $ cd code 
#    $ python simulationA.py
#
# 2. obey the relative path convention
#
# 3. check if ../results folder exists, create if not.
#
# 4. Generated PDF should be publication-ready.
#    there should be no post-processing required.
#
# 5. Try not to touch dss files manually unless it is absolutely necessary.
#    Use OpenDSS directives as much as possibles.
#
# 6. Keep relative path convention in DSS files.
