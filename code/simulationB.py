# Voltage magnitudes plot. 

# Requirements:
# -------------
# 1. Make sure the simulation can be run from code folder:
#
#    $ cd code 
#    $ python simulationB.py
#
# 2. obey the relative path convention
#
# 3. check if ../results folder exists, create if not.
#
# 4. Generated PDF should be publication-ready.
#    there should be no post-processing required.
