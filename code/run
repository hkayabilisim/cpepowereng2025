# Note about training
# -------------------
# Training scripts are disabled because they 
# take several hours to complete. 
# Instead, we conducted training on local resources
#Â and copy the generated policies to data/checkpoints folder.
# If you would like to train yourself, uncomment the following lines
# and make sure to change the policy folder in code/test.py
# 
#echo "Training for hour 9"
#python -u train.py --hour 9

#echo "Training for hour 12"
#python -u train.py --hour 12

#echo "Training for hour 16"
#python -u train.py --hour 16
